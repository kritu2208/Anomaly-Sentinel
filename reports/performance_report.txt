
    ANOMALY DETECTION PERFORMANCE REPORT
    ====================================
    
    Dataset Statistics:
    - Total data points: 9940
    - Time period: 2024-01-01 00:01:00 to 2024-01-01 02:46:39
    
    Detection Results:
    - Isolation Forest anomalies: 297 (3.0%)
    - LSTM anomalies: 440 (4.4%)
    - Anomalies detected by both methods: 7 (0.1%)
    
    Key Insights:
    1. The LSTM method detected 143 more anomalies than Isolation Forest
    2. Only 7 anomalies were detected by both methods (1.6% agreement)
    3. This suggests the methods are complementary:
       - Isolation Forest finds point anomalies (statistical outliers)
       - LSTM finds contextual anomalies (pattern deviations)
    
    Recommendation:
    For production use, consider combining both methods:
    - Use Isolation Forest for real-time point anomaly detection (low computational cost)
    - Use LSTM for periodic deep analysis of temporal patterns (higher accuracy)
